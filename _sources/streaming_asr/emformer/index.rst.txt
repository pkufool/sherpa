Streaming ASR with pruned stateless Emformer RNN-T
==================================================

This page describes how to use ``sherpa`` for streaming
ASR with the `Emformer <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10759>`_ model
trained using `pruned stateless RNN-T <https://github.com/k2-fsa/icefall>`_.


It consists of two parts:
